                <p class="description">In my first season for Liverpool Football Club, 
                    I scored 32 goals in 36 league games and won the Golden Boot award. 
                    I also won the Premier League trophy later that year, which is one of my 
                    biggest achivements in life. <br><br> Winning this trophy has been the most 
                    important lesson in my life. It was perhaps one of my most difficult seasons, 
                    with new people around me. I wuickly taught myself how to deal with these people and 
                    form a partnership and bond that lasted both on and off the field.</p>

                <p class="description">In 2021, I shifted my focus from Football to Web Designing. 
                    I signed up for AppleÂ´s design award where we had to make an app or game design. 
                    Out of the 100,000 participants, my design was named in the top 10 where I eventually 
                    made my mark by winning the award. <br><br> I made an app, collaborating with the 
                    Egyption designer Farida Temraz. The app was based on an online shopping app where 
                    customers could design their own clothes with sustainable material.</p>
