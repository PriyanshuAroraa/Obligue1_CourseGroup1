                <p class="description">In 2020, I wrote my bachelor thesis in programming. 
                    This thesis was given by "Wide Assessment" where the thesis was to create a 
                    notification center for an already existing platform. <br><br>
                    In the thesis we used C #, Java and .Net Core. In addition to this we used 
                    typescript. This thesis got a grade A.</p>

                <p class="description">In 2019 I took on my first project for Geodata AS, as a young 
                    web developer. I worked on a project where a customer could use the payment method 
                    Vipps on their website. <br><br> My work was orginally to program the software which could 
                    register the payment in their database, but alongside this i used my web designing 
                    skills to help out the other consultants to design the website as well.

                <p class="description">In 2020, I signed up for AppleÂ´s design award where we had to make 
                    an app or game design. Out of the 100,000 participants, my design was named in the top 10 
                    where I eventually made my mark by winning the award. <br><br> I made an app, 
                    collaborating with the Egyption designer Farida Temraz. The app was based on an 
                    online shopping app where customers could design their own clothes with sustainable material.</p>
