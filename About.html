                When we started with this task, the group decided to draw up different ideas on design 
                and design on paper. Then we discussed the various semantic tags we should use to make 
                the website simplest and most tidy. We started by creating a body (with a different style, 
                due to different heights) where all the semantic tags would go. Then all the web pages have 
                a "Header", where we have a headline, description, images, blockquote etc. to describe the 
                purpose of the element. Then we used "Section" to elementate the main content of the website. 
                We also have a "Footer", which contains a hub bar to navigate between the different pages.

            <hr>

                After we had made clear how we were going to incorporate the semantic tags on our 
                websites it was time to execute. Most of the semantic we use on our pages are the 
                "Header", "Section" and "Footer" tags. In our opinion these are great tags to use as 
                    they very clearly point out where the top, middle and bottom of the webpage is. 
                    They make it easy to pick up the code where we left it making the work progress 
                    more efficient.
